## Project Objective : 

To evaluate the problem-solving approach and data analysis skills for Product Management.

## Problem Statement : 

A taxi aggregation app is trying to introduce subscription plans which can offer some additional benefits to the user and in turn, can increase user loyalty.

1. What should be the benefits offered? Please explain the approach via which these benefits can be decided.
   
2. What should be the metrics of measurement and target metrics of success for MVP?
    
3. Please illustrate the basic user journey using wireframes via which the user can be nudged for a subscription (and at what touchpoints).

Please specify any assumptions that you might have taken in the solution.
